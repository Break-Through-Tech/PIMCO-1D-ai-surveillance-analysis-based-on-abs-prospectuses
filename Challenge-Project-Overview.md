## BTT Internal Evaluation Notes

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Python Compatibility | Green | Pure-Python stack (pandas, pypdf, an LLM/embedding client, numpy, scikit-learn, Streamlit). The heavier agent framework has been moved to an optional stretch goal, so the core project stays within reach of students with introductory CS/ML background. |
| Data Readiness | Green | Dataset is now specified: ≤100 SEC EDGAR 424B ABS prospectuses, ≤1 GB, PDF/text, with clear preprocessing notes (text extraction, per-deal organization, table/scan noise). |
| Resource Check | Green | No specialized hardware or proprietary software issues are identified in the submission. The tools indicated are available for student access. |

**Student Fit Score:** 8/10  
**Technical Depth Score:** 7/10  
**Overall Recommendation:** REVISED (to be determined by BTT)

**Advisor Feedback Draft:**
The project offers a practical, well-scoped introduction to retrieval-augmented Q&A over real-world financial documents. The scope has been staged into three tiers — (1) data collection + parsing + metadata filtering, (2) embedding-based semantic Q&A, and (3) an optional agentic layer as a stretch goal — so every team can reach a meaningful deliverable while stronger teams still have room to grow. Dataset size and format are specified, and the evaluation approach (retrieval precision + LLM-as-judge) is appropriate for the student level.

## The Challenge

### Project Summary
Build a **question-answering assistant over a library of SEC ABS prospectuses**. A user asks a plain-English question — for example, *"Which deals appear to use paper (physical) custody?"* — and the system searches the document collection and returns the most relevant deals along with the supporting text snippets.

The project is intentionally **staged from simple to advanced** so that every team reaches a working deliverable:
- **Start simple:** keyword / regular-expression search plus metadata filtering over parsed documents.
- **Then add semantics:** embedding-based retrieval so the assistant can match meaning, not just exact words, and let an LLM summarize the answer with citations.
- **Stretch goal (optional):** a small multi-step "agent" that plans, retrieves, reasons, and reports.

Think of it as a lightweight, student-friendly version of a document-surveillance tool: the goal is learning the full retrieval-augmented Q&A workflow on real financial documents, not building a production system.

### Success Criteria
1. Meet the key deliverables and milestones described below (reaching Milestone 1 alone is already a solid result).
2. On a small held-out set of ~15–20 test questions, the assistant returns the relevant deal(s) among its top results and shows the supporting text/source for each answer.

### Project Milestones

The deliverables are staged so each milestone builds on the previous one. **Finishing Milestone 1 counts as success; Milestones 2–3 raise the ceiling.**

1. **Milestone 1 — Data collection, parsing & metadata filtering (September).** Download a set of ABS prospectuses (424B filings) from SEC EDGAR, extract the text from the PDFs, and build a simple index table (deal name / ticker / filing / extracted text). Support basic keyword or regular-expression search and filtering by metadata (e.g., year, deal type). *Reaching this milestone already meets the bar.*
2. **Milestone 2 — Embedding-based semantic Q&A (October).** Add vector embeddings (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`) and similarity search so users can ask natural-language questions, then have an LLM produce a short answer with citations back to the source deals.
3. **Milestone 3 — Simple user interface + evaluation (November).** Wrap the assistant in a lightweight UI (e.g., Streamlit or Gradio) and evaluate it against the test-question set.
4. **Stretch / bonus (optional, for teams that finish early).** Build a small multi-step agent (plan → retrieve → reason → report) — e.g. using the OpenAI Agents SDK — add an automatic answer-quality checker, or support cross-deal summarization. This is entirely optional and not required for a successful project.

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## Dataset

**Name and Source:** Real ABS prospectuses from SEC EDGAR 424B filings  
**Format:** Text, PDF   
**Size:** ≤ 1 GB (roughly 50–100 filings is plenty to start)  
**Location:** https://www.sec.gov/search-filings or https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/

### Key Details
- Publicly available offering documents (prospectuses) for asset-backed securities (ABS) deals — long, text-heavy PDFs describing deal structure, collateral, servicing, custody, and legal terms.
- Preprocessing needed: extract text from PDFs (some filings are scanned or contain tables, which can add noise), then organize the text per deal for indexing and search.
- Data is free and public via SEC EDGAR full-text search; no login, credentials, or proprietary data are required.

## Suggested Approach

**ML Problem Type:** Large Language Models (LLMs) / Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

> The examples below are just starting points — teams are free to pick equivalent tools. Any LLM provider works (e.g. OpenAI, or OpenRouter, which offers many models including some free tiers).

**Recommended Libraries:**
- `pandas`, `numpy` — data handling and the index table
- `pypdf` / `PyPDF2` — PDF text extraction
- `sec-edgar-downloader` (or plain `requests`) — pulling filings from EDGAR
- An LLM / embedding client — e.g. `openai`, or any other provider (OpenRouter gives access to many models, including some free tiers). Embeddings such as `text-embedding-3-small` plus LLM answers.
- `scikit-learn` — simple similarity / nearest-neighbor search
- `streamlit` or `gradio` — the Milestone 3 user interface
- *(Optional, stretch goal only:* an agent framework such as the OpenAI Agents SDK — not needed for the core project.)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Retrieval precision / recall @ k** — does the correct deal appear in the top-k results for each test question?
- **LLM-as-judge** — use an LLM to rate whether each generated answer is correct and well-supported by the cited source.
- Light manual spot-checks — confirm answers point to the right deal and text.
